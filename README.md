Bootstrap Excercise

I took a long time on the media queries excercise, so this was kind of rushed, the ease of implementing it was awesome, I love the hamburger nav button.

I learned how to copy and paste somebody elses's divs, I need to review css selectors as anytime I tried to override a selector for bootstrap I had to cheat and use !important.  I really didn't spend much time in dev mode after making the navbar.

Looking forward to taking advantage of bootstrap layouts further in class.
